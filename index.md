👋🏽 Hey, I'm [Arpit Agrawal](https://arpit.codes), and this site is dedicated to my personal notes. This is where I jot down stuff and keep a record of everything I'm learning.

These notes existed on Notion at some point in time, but I've taken inspiration from Chris Coyier to put my [words at a URL](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/11/🧠💭✏%EF%B8%8F/) and share it with the world. Happy reading!

## Colophon

- The site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)
- It uses a modified version of the [Eleventy Notes](https://eleventy-notes.sandroroth.com/) starter
