Ben Thompson writes on private corporations as benevolent dictatorships and the value of democracy in government in [Libra’s Questionable Benefits, Facebook’s Hidden Costs, Philosophical Objections](https://stratechery.com/2019/libras-questionable-benefits-facebooks-hidden-costs-philosophical-objections/):

> There is a reason that private corporations are not democracies, but rather benevolent dictatorships: that is generally an approach that yields much more efficiency and competitiveness, and if the dictator is wrong, the company goes out of business. That isn’t great for shareholders or employees, but society generally can handle the downside.
>
> Government is another matter: I get that anything government related can be immensely frustrating and slow-moving, but the stakes are so much higher that the downside of things going wrong should weigh much more heavily into the consideration of what form that government should take. I am reminded of the Winston Churchill quote: “It has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”

In [Manifestos and Monopolies](https://stratechery.com/2017/manifestos-and-monopolies/), Ben Thompson writes on the dangers of centralized power, highlighting its inefficiency and potential for disastrous consequences:

> […] centralized power is both inefficient and dangerous: no one person, or company, can figure out optimal solutions for everyone on their own, and history is riddled with examples of central planners ostensibly acting with the best of intentions — at least in their own minds — resulting in the most horrific of consequences; those consequences sometimes take the form of overt costs, both economic and humanitarian, and sometimes those costs are foregone opportunities and innovations. Usually it’s both.
