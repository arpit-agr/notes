Cabel Sasser on [design and theme parks]({{ canonical }}):

> Design is global. No one person can have all the world’s understanding. And that can lead to blind spots. I think there’s a good argument to be made that a more diverse team of empowered designers working together could catch a lot more potential real-world design pitfalls.

> […] good design isn’t just beautiful and incredible and boundary-pushing, it also remembers what it means to be human.
