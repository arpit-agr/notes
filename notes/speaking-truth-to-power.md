[Gautam Bhatia](https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2023/08/01/iclp-turns-10-for-the-record/) on why he persists in writing about about the Indian Constitution:

> […] in the bleaker moments, the words of the Kenyan civil rights lawyer, Waikwa Wainyoke, serve as a [little star of Eärendil](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Star_of_Eärendil): Wainyoke recounts asking Pheroze Nowrojee (one of the doyens of Kenyan civil rights law) why they kept challenging the President’s authoritarian actions in court through the dark periods of Kenyan history, when it was clear they would lose every time. To this Nowrojee – as Wainyoke recounts – said: <q>For the record! Nothing is more powerful in history than the record.</q>

This brought to mind words from [Ravish Kumar's Ramon Magsaysay Award Acceptance Speech](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/full-text-of-ravish-kumars-ramon-magsaysay-award-acceptance-speech-2098005):

> Not all battles are fought for victory - some are fought to tell the world that someone was there on the battlefield.
