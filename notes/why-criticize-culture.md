Nathan J. Robinson on [Why We Must Criticize Our Culture](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2023/01/why-we-must-criticize-our-culture/):

> A critical intelligence is one that doesn’t accept the society and culture around us as a given, and demands explanations for it. Sometimes, when we do that, we find that things that seemed “normal” are actually incompatible with basic principles of justice. We come to see the familiar as strange again, and be unsettled by things we once accepted.

> Critics help us see that what is in front of us is not the only thing we could have been offered. By explaining how something ought to have been, the critic draws attention to alternate paths. I don’t mean to encourage greater negativity in a world already overflowing with it, but there is a sense in which all criticism is constructive criticism, because all criticism implies that there are possibilities other than the present incarnation of whatever is being criticized.
